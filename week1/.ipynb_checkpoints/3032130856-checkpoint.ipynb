    "* You may talk with other students about the lab, but each student is responsible for doing all exercises in the lab themselves and turning in their own write up. We will be checking code for evidence of copying and pasting.\n",
    "* When you are done with the lab, please restart the kernel and run all the codes one more time (press the \">>\" button), so that the grader will see a clean notebook. Don't forget to save! Please submit this lab to bCourses as `YOURCAL1ID.ipynb`. This will facilitate anonymous grading.\n",
    "* The class just recently transitioned from Matlab to Python. This is a newly developed assignment, so if you think there is an error or something is unclear, let us know right away. That will be extremely helpful to us and your fellow students.\n",
    "* These labs have been developed over the years by Solomon Hsiang, and past/current GSIs including Ian Bolliger, Tamma Carleton, Shubham Goel, Felipe GonzÃ¡lez, Luna Yue Huang, Jonathan Kadish, and Jonathan Proctor (in alphabetical order)."

    "## 3. `import` modules\n",
    "As we saw, Python's core library doesn't have that many functions. In order to use functions that people have written before, but are not included in core Python, we need to load a library. In Python, this is done via the `import` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only talk about absolute import (importing standard libraries that you've installed with `pip` or `conda`) and not relative import (importing codes that you have written but live elsewhere on your laptop), because the latter can be complicated and is not necessary for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest importing happens this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to access all the functions in the `numpy` library. Access these functions (or objects) by using a dot, like this: `numpy.array()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention for importing some standard packages is to give them a shorter name (this is called aliasing), so that you don't have to type that many characters. This is done via `import ... as ...`, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import scipy as sp\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course give them different names of your choice, e.g., `import numpy as bunny`, but that is bad coding practice (it is confusing to the readers) and is strongly discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to import everything (for example, if you want to use just one function from a huge library), do `from ... import ...` and then you can access the function directly, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can then use `array()` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries (python calls them modules) have submodules. For example, `scipy` has a submodule `scipy.optimize`. You can either `import scipy.optimize` or `from scipy import optimize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you import a module, its submodules are not always automatically imported! If you do `import scipy`, for example, its submodule `scipy.optimize` is NOT imported. You have to explicitly import the submodule as well.** There are some exceptions, however, e.g., `os` submodules are imported with the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "_[optional] To fully understand Python's `import` command, you need to understand the Namespace concept in Python, which is a great feature. We will introduce that later on in this class._"
