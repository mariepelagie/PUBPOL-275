    "* When you are done with the lab, please restart the kernel and run all the codes one more time (press the \">>\" button), so that the grader will see a clean notebook. Don't forget to save! Please submit this lab to bCourses as `YOURCAL1ID.ipynb`. This will facilitate anonymous grading.\n",

    "As we saw, Python's core library doesn't have that many functions. In order to use functions that people have written before, but are not included in core Python, we need to load a library. In Python, this is done via the `import` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only talk about absolute import (importing standard libraries that you've installed with `pip` or `conda`) and not relative import (importing codes that you have written but live elsewhere on your laptop), because the latter can be complicated and is not necessary for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest importing happens this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to access all the functions in the `numpy` library. Access these functions (or objects) by using a dot, like this: `numpy.array()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention for importing some standard packages is to give them a shorter name (this is called aliasing), so that you don't have to type that many characters. This is done via `import ... as ...`, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import scipy as sp\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course give them different names of your choice, e.g., `import numpy as bunny`, but that is bad coding practice (it is confusing to the readers) and is strongly discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to import everything (for example, if you want to use just one function from a huge library), do `from ... import ...` and then you can access the function directly, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can then use `array()` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries (python calls them modules) have submodules. For example, `scipy` has a submodule `scipy.optimize`. You can either `import scipy.optimize` or `from scipy import optimize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you import a module, its submodules are not always automatically imported! If you do `import scipy`, for example, its submodule `scipy.optimize` is NOT imported. You have to explicitly import the submodule as well.** There are some exceptions, however, e.g., `os` submodules are imported with the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "_[optional] To fully understand Python's `import` command, you need to understand the Namespace concept in Python, which is a great feature. We will introduce that later on in this class._"

    "We discussed in the lecture that we can create a mapping between an address and a geo-coordinate. Now we will try to do this with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will have to get to know some of the standard ways in which people represent geospatial objects. The two most popular conventions for representing these are shapefiles (`.shp`) and `.geojson` files. You will see an example of a geojson file below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.14. Now, let's plot something real: plot Goldman School with 'xb', Downtown Berkeley BART Station with '.g', and Campanile with '^r').**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be doing what is typically called a geocoding API (Application Programming Interface) request. This is where you put in an address (or some other sort of query keywords) and get the spatial coordinates. You do this on a daily basis when you type an address in Google Maps and find the latitude and longitude of that place. As we will learn more about API requests in the future, we do not require that you do this programmatically, but you are welcome to do that if you like challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this manually but still using geocoding APIs (with OpenStreetMap), examine this url:\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the part before \"?\". The question mark (\"?\") marks the start of the arguments that you are passing into the API. We are passed two arguments -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `q` (for query) is campanile berkeley (OSM is usually smart enough to parse fuzzy addresses like this one), we use \"+\" instead of a space because space creates problems in urls.\n",
    "2. `format` is `geojson`, which is a format commonly used to store geocoded geometries. (Use this format for your other queries, too.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert an equal sign \"=\" between a parameter and an argument (the value that you want to assign to a parameter), and insert ampersands \"&\" between arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the following when you click on the link above, as you can imagine, you can extract the coordinates (the last two numbers) programmatically fairly easily (and you will have to do that if you have thousands of coordinates), but for now let's do it by hand.\n",
